Our project to learn and manifest reinforcement learning projects.

------------


## Projects

#### [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/United-AI/smart_tictactoe) (in development):
Our first project is to develop a simple and intelligent agent that can play tic-tac-toe.

Tasks:
1. Coding a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game
2. Implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm

## First steps into reinforcement learning
#### Some useful tutorials to get you started. 

#### Follow the tutorial below and try to play a bit with the configuration data to get a feel for the NEAT libary.
